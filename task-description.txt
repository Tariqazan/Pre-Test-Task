A tech fair is being held in some venue called BICC Outdoor.
It has n Aisles and m Rows; You can check on the internet for the definitions of 
Rows and Aisles - 
The seating arrangement of an
Airplane is a perfect example to understand. 
However, Stalls are distributed on both sides (LEFT and RIGHT)
of the Aisle. And those stalls are 
numbered vertically, increasing from the left side of the aisle until it 
reaches the bottom row; once it reaches the 
bottom, the numbering shifts to the 
right side and reverts to the top - please check the image for an explanation. 
A stall can have 1 to 4 floors, and each floor can have up to 7 Rooms. 
And all floors of a stall have the same number of rooms. The color of a particular 
floor should be the same along the venue/stalls. You are provided the 
database fair.sql with four tables and are not allowed to modify the database.

First Task is to regenerate the layout as shown in the figure shown as stalls-plan.png.
The second task is to create the listing of rooms according to the floor, as shown in 
figure floor-wise-rooms.png
